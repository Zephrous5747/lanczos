# Lanczos
Memory-efficient implementation of Lanczos iteration for estimating Hamiltonian spectrum range.

Data structure: sdstate and fstate, dictionary implementation of slater determinant states, with integar or binary string as hash key

Accepts Hamiltonian as openfermion.FermionOperator, compute the energy expectation by applying the Hamiltonian to the state
